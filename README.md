// Pacific Art Assets remastered by Duion.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the art assets from the Garagegames Pacific Demo that has been
released under MIT license in a remastered version.

The reason for this repository is to provide the source files for the Pacific
assets that have been converted and extended to be used in Uebergame and
also for everyone else that may wants to use those assets directly in Torque3D.

I found that many of the Pacific assets need some work to work better with
the latest version of the engine or could just use some improvement and/or
just being extended upon.

Terrain textures:
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The terrain textures have been improved to work better with the new terrain
system and blend mode and also macro maps were generated.
If you want gameready versions with correct material settings then you should
look into the Uebergame repository: https://github.com/Duion/Uebergame
This repo just provides the source files.

Shapes:
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The shapes have been imported into blender and the LOD levels, collision meshes,
polycount etc have been improved to perform better inside Torque3D.
Some models even got completely remade and/or new variations have been created.
Some of the textures have also been cleaned up and renamed etc.
For gameready versions and scripts look into the Uebergame repository.
This repo just provides .blend files, that can be directly opened in Blender.

More assets will follow when I need them and got time to convert/improve them.
